# Chasers-of-the-Lost-Data
Space Apps Challenge 2019

Hello everyone, the name of our team is Arcade GT, we are participating in SpaceApps Challenge 2019 event. Our project is called Space DS, which is the solution for the Chasers of the Lost Data challenge.

The project consists of doing a process of data cleaning and then make a training model that uses the data as inputs, for this specific case, we use two data sets proposed by NASA, which are: Fireball And Bolide Reports and Meteorite Landings. Each data set had its particular challenge to be treated and cleaned, methods were used to remove Null values, calculate magnitudes and averages, all these procedures are basic but laborious in the area of Data Science.

Then we proceeded to create a training model that could predict different variables of each data set, in this particular case was used the method of Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron. In conclusion, it can be seen that each data set requires a different treatment and that it is always very necessary to make a prior study to know the data and thus be able to make a good feature engineering, finally is an excellent challenge to apply the knowledge in Data Science, thank you for your attention.
